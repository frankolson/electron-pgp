# Electron GPG

An app for working with GnuPG.

## Getting Started

### Install and deploy

```shell
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/frankolson/electron-gpg.git
cd electron-gpg
yarn
yarn start
```

This will start the app in development mode and automatically launch the first window.

The app will reload if you make edits and you will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.
